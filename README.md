Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
# Kickstarting with Excel
Louis theater production was close, so she wanted to know how others did regarding their launch date and fundraising.

## Overview of Project
Using a Kickstarter dataset, campaign outcomes based their how many succeeded, failed and canceled and fundraising goal using Excel. 

### Purpose
Dataset over 1000+ much information could be hard to read or have better understanding, so analyzing, visualizing, analyzing and organizing converting date and time into readable, organizing data’s using charts and graphs to have a clear picture of what the data is trying to portray.

## Analysis and Challenges
This being my first time working deep on excel it was a little challenging getting the right results.
The data had unreadable data that need to be converted:
Unix timestamp to human-readable format. Using =J(((J2/60/60/24)+DATE(1970,1,1).

And this was used to extract the year “=YEAR ()”


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date




Looks like May Is the best time to launch a theater campaign but not in December. 









### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Campaings with goals 45,000 – 49,999 had a complete failure. 
less than 1000, 1000-4,999, 35,000-39,999,40,000-44,999 had 76% successful campaigns. 



### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
> This being my first deep dive into excel it was hard for me to balanced and finish on time but since the goal is to get the point and be able to get this done outside class which I was able to do. 
On the Edinburgh Research I keep on getting #N/A several times. I went back to the “Kickstarter” file and used the “CTRL+F” then searched for the file and copy pasted it to the “Edinburgh Research” then I was able to get the right data. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
> Nine years, from 2009 to2017, were covered by the data for the theater category in the Kickstarter dataset, although six of those nine years had no data for the month of May.
> December is not the month to launch a campaign. 


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

> When the percentage for successful is 76%, percentage failed is 24%. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
> Line chart can be used to compare categories.
